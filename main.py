    # We use a couple of events to allow cluster X to signal to cluster Y that
    # cluster X has launched all of its agents, and only then cluster Y will
    # launch its own agents. This allows us to launch clusters in parallel
    # while still giving a cluster that launched early a priority to launch all
    # of its agents before any of the clusters that were launched after it.
    # This prevents a situation where all clusters race to create agent
    # threads, saturating the thread pool, and as a result the clusters are in
    # a dead lock because non of them have enough agents to finish the
    # installation (a finished installation is necessary for agents to die and
    # make space in the thread pool). This synchronization of events makes it
    # so that only a single cluster at a time may have a partial amount of
    # agents launched. One cluster's "I've launched all of my agents" event is
    # another cluster's "can start all agents" event.

    # The reason we don't simply launch clusters one after the other is because
    # before launching agents, a cluster has a lot of work it needs to do, and
    # there's no reason for that work to be delayed. That mostly includes
    # creating CR's and waiting for the service to reconcile them.

    # since it doesn't have any cluster it needs to wait for.
